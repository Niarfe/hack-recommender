I was offered a permanent job by MScript immediately after the end of the two weeks. Spent my time on three additional projects for Barden as well as in-house VB.NET and .NET framework development including Rezziliant's website (www.rezziliant.com) and our MScript360.com web application for our customers. Programming for the web was a lot different than what I had been doing in 1999 and prior, but I caught on quickly and ramped up. MScript360 is an application for doctors and lawyers and anyone in a business with the need to dictate sound files which can be uploaded for processing by a transcriptionist and stored in a database. Also worked on our VB.NET Transcription Application, and before leaving in 2008, I worked on integrating Speech Recognition, based on Philips Speech Magic SDK, into our transcription process, which was a much-requested feature by our clients. Barden's other projects included converting their VB 6 and Access 2003 systems to VB.NET and SQL Server 2005 with Web Services, click-once deployment, stored procedures and Crystal Reports."

This requires a detailed inventory of current PO imaging devices, databases, workflows and 3rd party systems in 130 PO clinic locations (1000+ Providers). With the site information we'll formulate and execute a plan to consolidate these devices and 3rd party systems into the GE Centricity Clinical Archive (CCA) - a Vendor Neutral Archive. This project parallels the Health System Epic eHR implementation; at the conclusion of both initiatives, Houston Methodist will be a fully integrated electronic Health System.Current state: Houston Methodist hospitals major archives include the GE Centricity Enterprise PACS, GE Radiology RIS and PACS systems, a Cardiology PACS and the Digisonics DigiView cardiology system. Not all services and devices are integrated; many function in a stand alone capacity. The PO has numerous disparate legacy and client server PACS systems, dozens of freestanding diagnostic devices and a mixture of medical records schemas; however, the PACS are all IHE compliant.Scope -future state: Build and implement the Centricity Clinical Archive (Vendor Neutral Archive) by converting the existing GE Enterprise PACS into the VNA archive. All existing archives must be reconciled to a new Epic MRN then migrated. The PO PACS systems will be consolidated-migrated to the VNA. St. Joesph's & St. Catherine's radiology PACS will be migrated to the VNA. 35 existing cardiology disparate DigiView databases will consolidated into three (Echo/Vascular/Cath) & will be integrated with the VNA. In early 2017 the 3 DigiView databases will be consolidated & migrated to the Siemens Syngo system. We're implementing the GE MUSE & MARS systems; these will integrate with the VNA. Viewers: the GE Universal Viewer (diagnostic interpretations) & the GE Zero Foot Print viewer (view only)."
